                Current Status
            </h2>
            <p class=" justify">
                Currently, i am studying in the<a href="https://www.scu.edu.au/" target="_blank">SCU(southern Cross University)</a> and i am studying bachelor in information Technology(BIT). I was always intrested in the science and technology and planned to pursue my higher degree in the Information technology. SCU have got tri-semister courses and the units that i am studying for this semister is:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Pogramming I</li>
                <li>System Analysis</li>
                <li>Web developing</li>
            </ol>
            following are the units that are for the semister 1
            <ul>
                <li> Programming II</li>
                <li> Database Systems</li>
                <li>Object Oriented Program Development</li>

            </ul>

            These units are the major core units and its my intrested field too. I am hoping to learn codings and develop my skills from these units.

            <h2>My Future Plans
            </h2>
            <p class="center">
                I think i made the wise decision by enrollong at the <a href="https://www.scu.edu.au/" target="_blank">Southern Cross University</a> for my degree. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Southeren Cross University</span> is widely recocnised for its excellence in its research whereas it is the one of the best university in Australia. In terms of career, i see myself a sodtware developer in a multi-national company. My first step
                on that is to clear bachelor in IT with good grades. I am hoping that I will learn skills to develop and run highly efficient software systems. I will undertake the workplace internship which will later be counted in degree. It is clear
                that with any circumstances I will achieve my goals. On this course I will work hard, take help from tutors and study text
                books. I think I will do fine throughout this course.
